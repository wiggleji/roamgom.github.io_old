## _Very Simplified As nothing, Easy Abridged Short Comprehensive_
# **MYSQL Manual**
<br>

### This is a Simple Guide for MySQL written in English

### ~~For Korean Manual Here~~

For People Who have used `Python, C++, C etc..` might have used array to save data
to use them in your own program.

You need to insert all the datas for each files you make

unless creating module file to save them and load from the others.

<br>
To make a better, efficient, simplified Programs, we need a solution for these Datas.

That's why we need Database such as `MySQL, Oracle, MongoDB(NoSQL) etc`

How does it work? We Save Data in DB, Load from programs. Simple.
<br>
For Example, when you make a library program.

#### You'll need several **objects** like
- books
- shelves
- employee

#### and also **actions**, such as
- Insert / remove new books.
- borrow / return books.
- open / close library.

<br><br>

It will be annoying program to put these things into one file.
To Make this system efficiently, things should be **SIMPLE**
<br>
**Now you seperate this things into two types, Data or Actions.**
<br>
For Data, you'll make structure for _**books(Title, Author, Date), shelves(types of books, location), employee (Name, Salary)**_, Saved into Database
And Actions might be made through IDE.

So that's how it goes with Database.

Now we're going to look for this FUN, ~~EASY~~ Database with Contents below.
